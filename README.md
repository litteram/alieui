### modules

- `map_pins.lua`: Set opacity of the in-game blizz waypoint system to 100%, no
  need to hide it! Add new command `/uway` and `/way` if TomTom is not loaded.
- `sell_poor.lua`: sell poor items to poor merchants (for some reasons they
  really like gray stuff)
- `fast_loot.lua`: make it fast so I don't have to look at it.
